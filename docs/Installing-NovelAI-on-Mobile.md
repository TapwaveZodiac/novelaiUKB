Currently there is no application on the Google Play store, or the Apple App Store for NovelAI. However, NovelAI is available as a [Progressive Web Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application).

## Installation on Android

To install a PWA, you need to open [NovelAI's webpage](https://novelai.net) in your mobile browser. 

After that, open the browser's menu and look for an option like "**Install**" or "**Add to home screen**".

This will add a new icon to your home screen (it might be sent to a different page if it's full) to open up NovelAI. This removes all the browser headers and leaves more space for the interface.


## Installation on IOS

The procedure is similar to installing NovelAI on Android, the option is just found in the "**add to**" section: **Add to Home Screen.**
