# NovelAI Image Generator Enhancements

**NovelAI Image Generator Enhancements** is a userscript for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/), or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), which brings quality-of-life and usability enhancements. Currently, it has a small but useful feature set, designed to fit in seamlessly with the NovelAI Image Generator's interface—as if it were meant to be there all along.

### Reference Strength Slider Patch

  - Range: allowed values down to -1
- Allows for more precise control over reference image influence.

### Smart Weight-Enhancer
- Intuitive weight editing for prompt tags:
  - Hover over any weighted tag (e.g., `1.2::blue hair::`) to see a tooltip with the current weight.
  - Scroll to adjust the weight:
    - Normal: ±0.05
    - Shift: ±0.01 (fine adjustment)
    - Ctrl: Snap to whole numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)

#### Example UI while hovering a weight

*Note: This feature does not support the "old" `{{{tag}}}` / `[[[tag]]]` emphasis format, but it will not break it.*
